## **üìùDescription:**

The Cypress Testing Project is a comprehensive testing solution that leverages Cypress for automated testing.
It showcases the powerful capabilities of Cypress IDE and TypeScript, providing a robust framework for testing web applications.
The README serves as a detailed guide for setting up, running, and utilizing the project effectively. 
It includes information on the project's purpose, technologies utilized, challenges encountered, and future feature enhancements.

## **ü§ñTech-Stack:**
 -Cypress IDE
 -TypeScript
 -NodeJs 
 -Git and Github
 -Cypress-mochawesome-reporter
 -Cypress Documentation
 -Typescript Documentation

## **File Structure:**
Set up projects and tests

## **üõ†Project Setup**

1)Install Node-js
2)Install IDE(Vscode)
3)Create a new folder.
4)Open the folder in Vscode.
5)Add typescript extension in Vscode
6)Add code runner

## **How to Use the Project:**

Step 1 - Create a new folder 
Step 2 - Open folder in VS Code 
Step 3 - Run commands
          npm init -y 
          npm install cypress
          npm install typescript 

Step 4- initialize a new tsconfig.json file using the command
          npx tsc --init --types cypress --lib dom,es
          This ensures that types for cypress are accessible by typescript These types depend on dom and es6, so we pass them as lib option to typescript 

Step 5 - Run command npx cypress open 

Step 6- Under cypress/integration folder create a test file basic.ts
Step 7  - Add test code
Step 8 - Run and verify
Step 9- Run the file
        file_name.cy.ts (write test cases here)
        OR
        -run by npx cypress open(to run on cypress Window)
        -run by npx cypress run(to run on console)

##**Folder Structure:**
*The e2e :Integration folder includes all the test files. The test files may be written as.js,.jsx,.coffee, and.cjsx.
Usually the preferred extension is.js, and the test file name format is test-name.spec.js.
All the test cases will be here.

*Fixture: Fixtures are used to store test data, which can then be used throughout the tests. Usually, the data is stored in JSON format.
This is the folder where all the test data is kept by default (like example.json).

*Screenshots and videos (MP4): these folders get created during the execution of tescases.Cypress records a video for each spec file when running tests during a Cypress run.
Videos are not automatically recorded during cypress open. 
Videos are stored in the videos folder, which is set to cypress/videos by default.

*cypress/downloads: This folder is automatically created when your test downloads any file and stores all the downloaded files. 

*Support :This folder contains index.js and commands.js files. This index.js file is run before every single spec file.
The support folder is a great place to put reusable behavior, such as custom commands. 

*command.js :use to define custom commands to define specific functionality

 *e2e.js: reference for component testing

*node_modules : All the libraries and dependencies required for Cypress test execution

*jsconfig.json: Added later to enable autocompletion

*package.json: It is similar to pom.xml in Java.
-dependency management file to specify all the required Cypress dependencies

*package-lock.json: This file is used to lock down the versions of your dependencies so             
 that your project will always use the same versions.
 regardless of when you install it. 

*cypress.config.json: a configuration file for you. This file will be cypress.config.js for JavaScript apps or cypress.config.ts for TypeScript apps. 
This file is used to store any configuration specific to Cypress.
